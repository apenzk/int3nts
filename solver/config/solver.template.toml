# Acceptance Criteria
# Defines which token pairs are supported and their exchange rates
[acceptance]
# Token pair format: "offered_chain_id:offered_token:desired_chain_id:desired_token" = exchange_rate
# Exchange rate = how many offered tokens per 1 desired token
# Example: If rate is 1.0, then 1 offered token = 1 desired token
# Example: If rate is 0.5, then 0.5 offered tokens = 1 desired token (offered token is worth more)

# Example: Token A (chain 1) -> Token B (chain 2) at 1:1 rate
"1:0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:2:0xbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb" = 1.0

# Example: USDC (Base Sepolia) -> USDC (Ethereum Sepolia) at 1:1 rate
# "84532:0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e:11155111:0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238" = 1.0

# Example: Token A (chain 1) -> Token C (chain 2) at 0.5 rate
# "1:0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:2:0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc" = 0.5
