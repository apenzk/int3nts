# Claude Code Instructions

## Commit Message Conventions

**IMPORTANT:** All commit messages must be concise and professional.

- Keep commit messages brief and to the point
- Do NOT include advertising, promotional text, or references to Claude/AI assistance
- Do NOT include phrases like "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- Focus on what changed and why, not who/what tool made the change

## Documentation

For information on how documentation is organized and how to navigate it, see [docs/docs-guide.md](docs/docs-guide.md).

### Markdown Style Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** All markdown files must follow these formatting rules:

- **Blank lines around headings**: There must be a blank line before and after all headings (MD022)
- **Blank lines around lists**: There must be a blank line before bullet lists and numbered lists (MD032)
- **No multiple blank lines**: Use only one blank line between sections (MD012)

These rules ensure consistent formatting and prevent linting errors. Always check linting errors before committing documentation changes.
