# Claude Code Instructions

## Commit Message Conventions

**IMPORTANT:** All commit messages must be concise and professional.

- Keep commit messages brief and to the point
- Do NOT include advertising, promotional text, or references to Claude/AI assistance
- Do NOT include phrases like "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- Focus on what changed and why, not who/what tool made the change
