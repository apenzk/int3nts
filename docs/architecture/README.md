# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains internal architectural guidance documents for the Intent Framework. These documents provide a comprehensive mental model of the system's architecture, domain organization, and design principles.

## Document Overview

### [Component-to-Domain Mapping](architecture-component-mapping.md)

Maps all source files to their respective domains and documents inter-domain interaction patterns. This is the primary reference for understanding how components are organized and how domains interact.

**Key Sections**:

- Domain Architecture Overview (visual diagram)
- Topological Order (build sequence)
- Domain Definitions
- Component Mapping
- Inter-Domain Interaction Patterns and Dependencies

### [Domain Boundaries and Interfaces](domain-boundaries-and-interfaces.md)

Provides precise definitions of domain boundaries, external interfaces, internal components, data ownership, and interaction protocols following RPG methodology principles.

**Key Sections**:

- Intent Management: Boundaries and Interfaces
- Escrow: Boundaries and Interfaces
- Settlement: Boundaries and Interfaces
- Verification: Boundaries and Interfaces

### [RPG Methodology Principles](rpg-methodology.md)

Explains the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) methodology principles and how they apply to the Intent Framework architecture. This document provides the theoretical foundation for the domain-based organization.

**Key Sections**:

- Dual-Semantics (Functional vs. Structural)
- Explicit Dependencies
- Topological Order
- Progressive Refinement

### [Data Models Documentation](data-models.md)

Comprehensive reference for all data structures used across the Intent Framework, including intent structs, escrow structs, event structures, and cross-chain data linking patterns.

**Key Sections**:

- Intent Management Domain (Move data structures)
- Event Structures (Move event emissions)
- Escrow Domain (Move and Solidity escrow structures)
- Verification Domain (Rust normalized event structures)
- Cross-Chain Data Linking patterns

### [Security Hardening Checklist](security-checklist.md)

Comprehensive security review guide for production deployment. Covers endpoint abuse prevention, client trust elimination, auth hardening, logging, 3rd party resilience, secrets management, and breach response planning.

**Key Sections**:

- Endpoint Abuse Prevention (rate limits, idempotency, validation)
- Client Trust Elimination (server-side checks only)
- Auth Hardening (edge cases, signature verification)
- Logging Infrastructure (audit trails, correlation IDs)
- 3rd Party Resilience (retries, fallbacks)
- Secrets Management (.env, rotation)
- Breach Response Plan (revocation, communication)

### [Conception Documents](conception/)

Documentation describing the conceptual design of the Intent Framework, including flows, scenarios, error cases, and security properties.

**Key Documents**:

- [Conception Generic](conception/conception_generic.md) - Introduction, actors, flow types, generic protocol steps, security properties, error cases, and risks
- [Conception Inflow](conception/conception_inflow.md) - Inflow flow (Connected Chain → Hub): use cases, protocol, scenarios, and protocol steps
- [Conception Outflow](conception/conception_outflow.md) - Outflow flow (Hub → Connected Chain): use cases, protocol, scenarios, and protocol steps
- [Conception Router Flow](conception/conception_routerflow.md) - Router flow (Connected Chain → Connected Chain): use cases, protocol, scenarios, and protocol steps
- [Architecture Differences](conception/architecture-diff.md) - Implementation status, function signatures, and differences from conception
- [Requirements](conception/requirements.md) - Functional and non-functional requirements

## How to Use These Documents

1. **New to the codebase?** Start with [Component-to-Domain Mapping](architecture-component-mapping.md) to understand how components are organized into domains.
2. **Need precise interface definitions?** See [Domain Boundaries and Interfaces](domain-boundaries-and-interfaces.md) for detailed boundary specifications.
3. **Understanding the design philosophy?** Read [RPG Methodology Principles](rpg-methodology.md) to understand why the architecture is organized this way.
4. **Need data structure details?** See [Data Models Documentation](data-models.md) for field-by-field documentation of all data structures.
5. **Understanding system behavior?** See [Conception Documents](conception/) for flows, scenarios, and error cases.
6. **Planning implementation?** Use the Topological Order sections to understand build dependencies and implementation sequence.
7. **Preparing for production?** See [Security Hardening Checklist](security-checklist.md) for security review requirements.
