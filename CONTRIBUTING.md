Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Intent Framework!

## Getting Started

Before contributing, make sure you've completed the setup steps in the [README.md](README.md#quick-start).

**Important**: Before making significant changes, familiarize yourself with the system architecture. See the [Architecture Documentation](.taskmaster/docs/README.md) for a comprehensive guide to the Intent Framework's domain-based architecture, component mapping, and design principles.

## Development Workflow

2. Make your changes following the existing code style:
   - Follow existing code conventions in each component
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update relevant documentation when adding features
3. Update documentation as needed (see the [Documentation Guide](docs/docs-guide.md) for documentation structure)
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request using the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
