# Intent Framework Project Rules

For guidance on how to write rules, see [Cursor Rules Documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules).

## Commit Message Conventions

After marking a subtask or task as done, create a commit with the changes

```bash
git commit -m "<type of change>: <description>

- <more detailed points if needed (optional)>
- <more detailed points if needed (optional)>

Tests pass: Move <amount>, EVM <amount>, Verifier (Rust) <number>, Solver (Rust) <number>
"
```

**IMPORTANT:** All commit messages must be concise and professional.

- Do NOT git add anything
- Keep commit messages brief and to the point
- Do NOT include advertising, promotional text, or references to Claude/AI assistance
- Do NOT include phrases like "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By ..."
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- Focus on what changed and why, not who/what tool made the change
- **Always include test results** at the end of the commit message in the format: `Tests pass: Move <amount>, EVM <amount>, Verifier (Rust) <number>, Solver (Rust) <number>`

## Context Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** The root [README.md](README.md) must always be included in context when working on this project. It provides essential project overview, quick start instructions, and links to all major components.

## Documentation

For information on how documentation is organized and how to navigate it, see [docs/docs-guide.md](docs/docs-guide.md).

### Markdown Style Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** All markdown files must follow these formatting rules:

- **Blank lines around headings**: There must be a blank line before and after all headings (MD022)
- **Blank lines around lists**: There must be a blank line before bullet lists and numbered lists (MD032)
- **No multiple blank lines**: Use only one blank line between sections (MD012)

These rules ensure consistent formatting and prevent linting errors. Always check linting errors before committing documentation changes.

## Project Overview

This is a cross-chain intent framework enabling conditional asset transfers across blockchain networks. The system supports both **inflow** (tokens locked on connected chain, desired on hub) and **outflow** (tokens locked on hub, desired on connected chain) flows.

For comprehensive architecture documentation, see `.taskmaster/docs/` - includes component-to-domain mapping, domain boundaries, data models, and use cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Organization

### Move/Aptos Contracts

See [Move Intent Framework Documentation](docs/move-intent-framework/README.md) for API reference, technical overview, and oracle-guarded intents. Planned cross-chain functions documented in [Implementation Plan](.taskmaster/implementplan.md).

### EVM/Solidity Contracts

See [EVM Intent Framework README](docs/evm-intent-framework/README.md) for contract interface and usage. Outflow transaction format documented in [Implementation Plan](.taskmaster/implementplan.md#scenario-b-evm-connected-chain).

### Rust Services

See [Trusted Verifier README](docs/trusted-verifier/README.md) and [Solver README](docs/solver/README.md) for service architecture and implementation details.

### Testing Infrastructure

See [Testing Infrastructure README](docs/testing-infra/README.md) for E2E test structure and utilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding Standards

See [`.cursor/codestandards.md`](.cursor/codestandards.md) for language-specific coding standards and conventions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation Standards

- **Location**: `docs/` directory
- **Structure**: Each major component has its own README.md
- **API docs**: Use code comments that can be extracted to API reference
- **Architecture docs**: Use mermaid diagrams for visual representation

## Testing Standards

- **Move tests**: Place in `move-intent-framework/tests/` with `*_tests.move` naming
- **Solidity tests**: Place in `evm-intent-framework/test/` with `*.test.js` naming
- **E2E tests**: Use shell scripts in `testing-infra/e2e-tests-*/`
- **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and clean up after itself
- **Balance checks**: Use granular balance display functions appropriate for the chain being tested

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling

- Move: Use `abort` with error codes defined in module
- Solidity: Use `require()` with descriptive error messages
- Rust: Use `anyhow::Result` and propagate errors with context
- Shell scripts: Use `set -e` and check return codes
